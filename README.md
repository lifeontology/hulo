HuLO: The Human Life Ontology

The HuLO is developed by extending the Life Ontology (LifO), a general purpose species-neural upper level ontology of life. Like LifO, the EcoLO developed is based on the OneNet Theory of Life: http://www.hegroup.org/onenettheory.html.

The HuLO aims to ontologically and systematically represent human life, including various human life entities and the relations among these entities.
